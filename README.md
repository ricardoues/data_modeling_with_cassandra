# Project: Data Modeling with Cassandra

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they have been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

They would like a data engineer to create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions, and wish to bring you on the project. Your role is to create a database for this analysis. You will be able to test your database by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.


# Project Overview 

In this project, we will apply what we have learned on data modeling with Apache Cassandra and complete an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we will need to model your data by creating tables in Apache Cassandra to run queries. We have developed an ETL pipeline that transfers data from a set of CSV files within a directory to create a streamlined CSV file to model and insert data into Apache Cassandra tables. 


# Files 
The project has the following files: 

* Project_1B.ipynb: an jupyter notebook file that contains the python code of the project.
* images: folder containing an image shown in the Project_1B.ipynb notebook.
* event_data: folder containing CSV files on user activity on the app.
* README.md: provides discussion on your project.

# How to run the project 

You must have Apache Cassandra 3.11 or greater installed in your computer, moreover you must have Python 3.5 or greater installed in your computer. In the file requirements.txt there is a list of the packages that you must install in your computer in order to run the codes properly.
